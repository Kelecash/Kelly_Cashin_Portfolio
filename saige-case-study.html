            <p><b>Context:</b> Saige Chefs was an Atlanta Startup that used machine learning to make meal recommendations for their users. Users could then subscribe to receive weekly deliveries of these meals. During the onboarding process, customers filled out their preferences. A new custom menu was generated for them each week.</p>
            <p><b>My Role:</b> Marketing Specialist
            <p><b>Special Note:</b> This is a look back at work I did while I was still learning about UX from a digital marketing role. I thought it would add context to how my interest in UX began, and how my process has developed since that time. Most notably, testing is missing from this project. This is something I would now incorporate into each step of the design process.</p>

            <h2><a name="phase1"><b>Phase One:</b> User Research</a></h2>
            <br>
            <p>Our research process was a collaboration between customer services and marketing. Our customer service team reported qualitative data from our user base. Our marketing team gathered quantitative data via FullStory.</p>
            <p>We found the biggest point of drop-off in the onboarding process was a step requiring users to create profiles for their family members. In the initial design, this step was intended to customize the user's experience. Each person on a plan was recommended dishes personalized to their taste. For new users, this step felt invasive. Before they could see what they were purchasing, they were expected to exchange their personal information.</p>
            <p>One argument against removing the profiles feature was that it would change the product for our activated customer. However, when we surveyed our users we found most ignored this feature entirely, while others found it to be limiting and inflexible. It was particularly frustrating when a member on their plan was traveling or had other plans for their meals. </p>

            <br>
            <p>Marketing already created a user persona, which we used when thinking about the onboarding redesign. Our user base were primarily younger. They had used similar services before, and they were searching for a healthier easier alternative to a service like Blue Apron.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, we knew the onboarding process needed to be sleek and easy to use. It needed to be familiar as well to remove any additional layers of complexity, which might take away from the overall purpose of our product. It also needed to be flexible to our user’s lifestyle, which was a challenge with the current product.</p>
            <p>Our takeaways were:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduce the overall number of steps in onboarding.</li>
                <li>Allow customers to see the product as early in the onboarding process as possible.</li>
                <li>Remove individual custom profiles from onboarding, introduce it as an advanced feature in the user settings for those who want to use it.</li>

            <br>
            <p>More than 90% of American consumers have used online retail for shopping, so to make sign-up intuitive for them, we sought inspiration from familiar retail sites. Many of the ideas gathered at this stage were inspired by similar services or taken from ecommerce check-outs.</p> 
            <p>The features we wanted to incorporate included:<p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A redesigned landing page that served more as a first step in onboarding rather than appearing like a pitch for investors- less copy, more images, more calls to action.</li>
                    <li>Filters to provide customers more flexibility- previously meals were selected for the user according to survey responses during onboarding. Users were then prevented from ever seeing meals they were interested based on their replied. We wanted to give the user more options, and in the future build a recommendation system that learned based on user behavior.</li>
                    <li>Use of images in the cart view with a detail modal to give users a product description with allergen information.</li>
                    <li>A cart view where users could choose see which meals they ordered across their entire account.</li>

            <br>
            <p>The goal was to get customers started right away by keeping our homepage minimalistic. We would move the text-heavy details to an FAQ for customers who wanted to do more exploring or research first.</p>
            <p>The overall sign-up process was shortened to four steps, which would take less time and reduce the potential for missed bugs when we deployed site updates. We added a progress bar with navigation arrows to help users orient themselves in the process.</p>
            <p>In creative, we were working on a visual representation of what the customer could expect to receive in their delivery to be shown on the checkout page. Again, the goal was to make a page that is familiar to people who have shopped online before so that they know their information is safe and secure. The follow-up to an order would include an email with what to expect and a pop-up survey for marketing purposes.</p>

            <br>
            <p>
                I left Saige before I had the chance to execute this project. There would have been several next steps to determine the impact of a new onboarding on our funnel.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Test the onboarding process and get user feedback to iterate the design.</li>
                <li>Create a final prototype.</li>
                <li>A/B test the final prototype against the previous onboarding to see if cart abandons decreased and conversions increased.</li>
            <p>
                Because developer time is expensive, I would have mimicked the new oboarding process with a MVP that utilized outside services (for example, a combination of Landing Lion, Mailchimp and Square) to prove our hypothesis that a new onboarding would improve our conversion rates.
