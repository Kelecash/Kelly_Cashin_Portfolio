            <br>
            <p>Our research process was guided by insights gathered by a series of interviews with a former TIFF PR rep who has planned several festivals of comparative size to the Atlanta Film Series festivals. He cautioned the importance of being inclusive and sensitive towards several different groups of people, which was something we had to consider throughout our entire research and design process.</p>
            <p>We also conducted a series of interviews with Atlanta residents who actively participated in local events. This was followed by two separate surveys. One targeted people who had a specific interest in attending film festivals for the first time. The other tageted people who had attended film festivals previously.</p>
            <p>The three more poignant takeaways from our research process:
                <ul>
                    <li>As designers, we will need to prove that the event planners value the safety of attendees before users will consider purchasing tickets.</li>
                    <li>The website material needs to be inclusive and welcoming of many different groups of people.</li>
                    <li>Most festival attendees are frustrated when their expectations aren’t met. Key information (such as the date, venue information, parking, etc) should be easily visible and accessible so they can plan accordingly.</li>

            <br>
            <p>A point of debate among our team was around our user persona. We were worried something overly specific would be too limiting in our design process. The nature of the event is to feature film that shares a variety of perspectives and experiences, thus bringing together many groups of people. We ultimately created an empathy map to avoid this- pulling directly from interview and survey data to uncover what common experiences people had.</p>
            <p>This helped us to define the user's experience via a storyboard.</p>
            <p>We knew one of our biggest tasks would be taking on the information architecture and branding, as each festival was hosted on a separate site with its own navigation and styles. Users needed to be able to discover content that was relevant to them in a seamless way.</p>

            <p>Using the “I like, I want, I wish “ method, we created a list of features we thought might be most useful in helping our users to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Consider</b> attending a social distanced event by providing accurate and up to date information about how the festivals are following CDC guidelines. </li>
                <li><b>Identify</b> key information on the price, time, and location that they need in order to make the decision to attend. </li>
                <li><b>Discover</b> relevant content that is interesting to them.</li>
                <li><b>Become excited</b> by videos and photos of the variety of films to be featured at the festivals. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>We then sorted features into a prioritization matrix based on what we thought was most achievable in our timeframe and what we thought would have the greatest impact on the user.</p>

            <p>Prototyping and testing occurred simultaneously. We were building out a new site map and navigation, so it was essential we received feedback on the overall information architecture from the very beginning.</p>
            <p>We took a mobile first approach and A/B tested early wireframes of our new sitemap using two mobile navigation styles. Based on the results of early testing, we knew a responsive dropdown menu made the most sense.</p>
            <p>We were also able to get clearer data about where people expected certain information to live on this website. This feedback was incorporated into the layout of each page.</p>

            <br>
            <p>In some of our early testing, issues users ran into came mostly around general confusion about whether these were four genres for a single film festival. If they purchased tickets, would they have access to each festivals? As a result, we felt mid-fi testing would be essential.</p>
            <p>We wanted it to be clear that the Atlanta Film Series was a single organization, and the festivals were four separate events hosted by the organization. We thought introducing a styled UI components and imagery would help make this more obvious.</p>
            <p>Our tests confirmed that the overall purpose of the site became clearer to the user, but we had some unexpected feedback on changes to be made to the overall style of the site. Particularly around the use of brand colors and accessibility. Some of these changes included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Changing the font in the navigation to san-serif.</li>
                <li>Blue buttons with white text for accessibility.</li>
                <li>Make the hero image stop above the fold so the user knew to scroll.</li>
                <li>Tighten up the layout to be consistent across the site to make it easier for the user to orient themselves.</li>
